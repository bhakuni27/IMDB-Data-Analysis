# Problem Statement

You are employed as a data scientist at SussexBudgetProductions. The last movie produced by the company was a comedy-action-thriller with a budget of £500K. It failed at the box office and only grossed £100K. So to keep the production company in business, the next film needs to make money. The CEO thinks they can persuade investors to give £1.5 million in funding over the next year, but needs to ensure a good return. Therefore, they have asked you to analyse the IMDB data provided in the movie metadata.csv file and come up with an actionable plan. You should assume that all budgets in the data file have been converted to GBP.

# IMDB-Data-Analysis

This analysis considers the elements that distinguish certain movies from others in terms of success. In order to ensure a high return, I would like to study what kinds of movies are more profitable.
I use the rate of return on investment(ROI) as the response variable in this analysis, and I concentrate on how the other factors in the IMDB movie dataset affect the response variable. The findings may aid Sussex Budget Productions in unravelling the formula for creating a box-office hit movie.
